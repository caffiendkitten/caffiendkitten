__Hi, my name is DaNeil__ ðŸ‘‹ I'm a quality-driven Mid level Security Consultant with a passion for performing responsible disclosure and aligning security controls, processes, policies and procedures. :space_invader:

I am experienced in leveraging tool-based testing, and manual hands-on testing, of web applications and network services while utilizing web and network application guidelines and following industry-standard best practices and methodologies, such as OWASP and PTES. I am passionate about Information Security and enthusiastic about finding security vulnerabilities. I am active within the Capture the Flag community and local tech meetup groups such as WISP, WoSec, and OWASP and this site will be built around my progress and my process of getting into Info Sec.
