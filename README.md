__Hi, my name is DaNeil__ ðŸ‘‹ I'm a quality-driven Associate Security Consultant and full stack software/security engineer with a passion for performing responsible disclosure and aligning security controls, processes, policies and procedures. :space_invader:

I am experienced in leveraging tool-based testing, and manual hands-on testing, of web applications and network services while utilizing web and network application guidelines and following industry-standard best practices and methodologies, such as OWASP and PTES. I am passionate about Information Security and enthusiastic about finding security vulnerabilities. I am active within the Capture the Flag community and local tech meetup groups such as the CyberSecurity Non-Profit that I am a chapter organizer for, WISP, WoSec, and OWASP and this site will be built around my progress and my process of getting into Info Sec.
